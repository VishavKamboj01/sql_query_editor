# SQL Compiler (Front-End)

# Overview...
-> This is basically a front-end application and does not include any backend services.
-> A user can enter a query and get the predefined output in form of a table.
-> Just like any other sql compiler, but it is not in sync with the query.
-> The layout is created simpler only adding the most needed features for writing queries faster.
-> The UI is clean and consise so that the users can focus on thier work. Rather than useless features.


# Libraris used
-> This is a single page application created with the help of React.js (Javascript Library).
-> Basic Bootstrap components have been used like dropdowns etc.
-> Google fonts are used for the overall font family.


# Key Features
-> Auto Completion: I have implemented auto completion with the help of Trie (Prefix Tree) Data structure
    to help the users in typing the quries faster.
-> Keyword Coloring: The Keywords are colored with a different color to differentiate them from the other code.
-> CSV File downloading: Users can download a csv file of the data they filtered using sql queries.


# Page Load Time
The page load time is 1.7s on mobile devices and 1.2s on desktop or laptop devices.
-> I have measured the page load time on Browser stack speed lab website.
